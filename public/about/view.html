              <h1>About</h1>
              <p class="lead text-left">Tessellated Security is a home security system aimed at the tinkerer, the do-it-yourself-er, and the hobbyist.  By offering an ulra lowcost service, home security is attainable to anyone with wifi internet, a smartphone, and the desire to play around, a little, with a tessel.</p>
              <p class="text-left">This site serves as the point where users of the service can register an account, register their tessel device(s), and update their information.</p>
              <p class="text-left">By first registering an account here, users then can get the information necessary to set up their own tessels as security systems.</p>
              <p class="text-left">Once a tessel is set up with the system, anytime a magnetic switch opens that's connected to the tessel, the user will receive an email notifying him or her that the door has opened.</p>
              <p class="text-left">Future planned features:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="text-left">Attaching a webcam to the tessel to pipe photos and eventually videos of intruders via email to users</li>
                <li class="text-left">Storing photos and videos both locally on the tessel via thumbdrive and within users' accounts on the Tessellated Security site</li>
                <li class="text-left">Being able to arm and disarm your tessel via number pad or switch, whichever you prefer for your security concerns</li>
                <li class="text-left">Setting up the tessel without using NPM</li>
                <li class="text-left">Integrating a payment system and subscriptions into the site</li>
                <li class="text-left">And much more!</li>
              </ul>

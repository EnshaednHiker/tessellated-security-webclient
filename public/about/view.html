              <p class="lead text-left">Tessellated Security is a home security system aimed at the tinkerer, the do-it-yourself-er, and the hobbyist.  By offering an ultra lowcost service, home security is attainable to anyone with wifi internet, a smartphone, and the desire to play around, a little, with a tessel.</p>
              <p class="text-left">This site serves as the point where users of the service can register an account, register their tessel device(s), and update their information.</p>
              <p class="text-left">By first registering an account here, users then can get the information necessary to set up their own tessels as security systems.</p>
              <p class="text-left">Once a tessel is set up with the system, anytime a magnetic switch opens that's connected to the tessel, the user will receive an email notifying him or her that the door has opened.</p>
              <h2 id="roadmap"><b><u>Roadmap</u></b></h2>
              <p class="text-left">Future planned features:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="text-left">Attaching a webcam to the tessel to pipe photos and eventually videos of intruders via email to users</li>
                <li class="text-left">Storing photos and videos both locally on the tessel via thumbdrive and within users' accounts on the Tessellated Security site</li>
                <li class="text-left">Being able to arm and disarm your tessel via number pad or switch, whichever you prefer for your security concerns</li>
                <li class="text-left">Setting up the tessel without using NPM</li>
                <li class="text-left">Integrating a payment system and subscriptions into the site</li>
                <li class="text-left">And much more!</li>
              </ul>

                  <li class="text-left">Click on "Login/Register" in the nav bar</li>
                  <li class="text-left">Fill in information to add an register an account or log in to an existing account. The email you put in will be the email that you will receive alerts through. The email can be changed later if you wish.</li>
                  <li class="text-left">Add a device to your account. Give it a name that will be meaningful for the alert you receive. For instance, if you gave your device the name "back door," the alert you'll receive from that device will be "Alert: the back door opened."</li>
                  <li class="text-left">Copy the token that gets generated by the site. This token is used later in setting up code on the tessel.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="text-left">Note: say you add a device your account in the website, set up a tessel with that generated token, and then install a token on a door. If you delete your device in your accout, that will render that device useless, and you'll need to add a new device your account, push code again to the tessel with the newly generated token, and then reinstall the token on your door.</p>

              <p class="text-left lead"><b>3. Assembly - putting together the tessel</b></p>
              <p class="text-left">Watch the video for a comprehensive walthrough on how the pieces should fit together. It's pretty simple, but you may need some wire strippers to expose more of the wire to get it seat fully into the connectors.</p>
              <ol>
                  <li class="text-left">The short wire of the magnetic switch goes in the "GND" port on Port side A.</li>
                  <li class="text-left">The long wire of the magnetic switch goes in the "2" port on Port side A.</li>
                  <li class="text-left">If those wires aren't in those exact spots, the tessel will not work.</li>
                  <li class="text-left">Insert the USB micro-B cable into the appropriate slot. It is a little stiff the first time you put it in. The tessel can run off USB power when plugged into your computer. This if fine for when you are setting up code on your tessel.</li>
                  <li class="text-left">When you want your tessel to work in the real world, you'll want to hook up your USB power adapter instead of relying on power from your computer.
                  Note: the wires from the magnetic switch fit very loosely into the tessel, so you'll need to find a way get them to stay.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="text-left lead"><b>4. Push code to tessel with the NPM package via command line commands</b></p>
              <p class="text-left">Watch the video for a comprehensive walthrough on how to push the code to the tessel</p>
              <p class="text-left"><b>Install</b></p>
              <code class="text-left">npm install -g tessellated-security</code>
              <p class="text-left"><b>Usage</b></p>
              <ol>
                    <li class="text-left">
                        <p>Make sure you are using the LTS version of Node/npm package manager. That can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-left">
                        <p>Go to the command line utility on your computer. I am a fan of <a href="http://cmder.net/">cmder</a> if you're on a Windows computer but the Command Prompt program will work fine too. If you're on Mac or Linux machine, you are on your own.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-left">
                        <p>Before installing the files on your tessel, you will need to set it up. Read all through steps 0, 1, and 2 <a href="https://tessel.github.io/t2-start/">here</a>, and do steps 1 and 2.  This package depends on you already having installed the tessel CLI via <code>npm install -g t2-cli</code> in the command line.  This system also requires that your tessel have access to the internet, so make sure you follow the instructions in step 2 on how to set up wifi on your tessel. NOTE: I had a weird wifi setup with a poorly set up DSL modem and router, and did a ton of reading up on stack overflow and tessel developer communities only to realize that the problem was not the tessel and was in fact my weird internet setup. Simply by upgrading to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0111MRL4S/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Wi-Fi VDSL/ADSL Modem Router</a> for Centurylink DSL internet, I totally fixed my problem. FYI in case someone else has a similar problem with setting up their wifi on their tessel.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-left">
                        <p>Go into your command line program of choice and type <code>npm install -g tessellated-security</code> and hit enter. This installs the package globally, meaning you don't have to know where package files are in your system in order to access them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-left">
                        <p>Go to the <a href="https://enshaednhiker.github.io/tessellated-security-webclient/">Tessellated Security website</a> and create an account. Click the 'Register' tab in the navigation bar, enter your information, and click the submit button. On your account page, enter the name of your device and hit enter. Most likely you will want to name it something that connotes which door it is guarding i.e. backdoor, garage door, front door, etc. When you receive alerts from the tessel whenever the door opens, whatever you named your tessel clues you in as to which door opened. On your account page with the tessel device added to your account, copy the entire token to your clipboard.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-left">
                        <p>With your tessel plugged in via usb to your computer, type <code>tessellated-security</code> in your command line program and hit enter. You will then be prompted to enter a token. Paste in your token you copied from your account page on the Tessellated Security website.  Hit enter.  Your tessel will then take about 2 to 3 minutes to get set up on and push over the files to make the system work. Once the process is over, you can unplug your tessel from your computer and install it on your door of choice. Now, whenever that tessel is connected to power and wifi, your security system will run, and you will receive emails noting each time that door opens/whenever the magnet separates.</p>

              <p class="text-left lead"><b>5. Install tessel onto a door</b></p>
              <p class="text-left">The magnetic switch I've listed in the spec sheet works but is flimsy and made of plastic. In a more polished product, a sturdier switch would need to be used.  Given that this is a DIY project for enjoyment and your own personal fun, I don't recommend that you use the screws to screw this switch onto an actual door. Some kind of command strips from 3M would probably be more appropriate. The magnetic switch itself comes with tape on its back, but that's obviously only a one-time use.</p>
